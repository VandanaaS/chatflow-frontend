# Tradeoff Analysis

✅ Chose MERN stack for developer velocity & real-time capabilities.
✅ Used JWT auth (simpler but no refresh token yet).
✅ Used Socket.io for simplicity vs pure WebSocket (simpler room management).
✅ Initial UI kept minimal for feature focus over design polish.

⏳ Deferred:
- Message receipts (sent/delivered/read)
- Group management UI
- Token refresh mechanism
- End-to-end encryption
- Advanced monitoring & alerting
- Front end validations like email upon regitration, removal of logout in the login page and enriched UI \ UX
