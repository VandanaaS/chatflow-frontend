Platform: Render.com

### 1) Backend Code Structure
- server.js
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- .env.example (no secrets committed)
- MongoDB Atlas for database

### 2) Render Setup Steps
- Created Render account
- Created New Web Service linked to GitHub repo (chatflow-backend)
- Root Directory: `/`
- Build Command: `npm install`
- Start Command: `node server.js`
- Node version automatically detected

### 3) Environment Variables Configured in Render
- MONGO_URI = MongoDB Atlas cluster connection string
- JWT_SECRET = secret key used for JWT token signing

### 4) CORS Configuration in server.js (Socket.io)
```
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: [
      "https://mernchatapp.netlify.app"
    ],
    methods: ["GET", "POST"],
    credentials: true
  }
});
```

### 5) Verification
- Upon deployment, Render provides backend URL: https://chatflow-backend-xxxx.onrender.com
- Accessible by frontend via API calls
